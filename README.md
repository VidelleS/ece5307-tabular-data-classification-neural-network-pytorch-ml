# ece5307-tabular-data-classification-neural-network-pytorch-ml
Developed a fully connected neural network from the ground up using PyTorch to classify multi-feature tabular data. Implemented PCA for dimensionality reduction, class-weighted loss to address imbalance, K-fold cross-validation, early stopping, and adaptive learning rate scheduling. Trained and optimized the model to achieve ~95% local validation accuracy (86% on Kaggle leaderboard). Unlike the course labs—which focused on fine-tuning and optimizing pre-structured or pre-trained models—this project involved designing, coding, and training the architecture entirely from scratch, demonstrating a full understanding of model development, optimization, and deployment workflows.
